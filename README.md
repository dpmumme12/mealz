Mealz

== Description ==
<br>
I built this site using flask and utilizing PostgreSQL for my database and bootstrap to make the front end. The project's name is called 
mealz and it is a meal planner that uses an api offered by spoonacular to look up different kinds of meals, their recipes and how to cook them.
You start off by making an account and then you are taken to the home page where you can see your meal schedule for the week. You can then 
search for meal to add to your schedule or click on the meals on your schedule to see the recipe and instructions on how to cook. Click the link below to view the demo, enjoy!
